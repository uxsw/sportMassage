				<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Mark has provided me with a deep tissue massage service for many years. In each session he has conscientiously and rigorously treated the muscle tissue to help to manage issues and to warn of potential pending issues. This has helped me to remain injury for as long as possible.</p>
 
<p>However, Mark has also provided a service as a mentor. Sounding out my training ideas and critiquing and challenging my thoughts and findings in such a way that has got me to think the extra step beyond each process; we have covered a multitude of aspects of running in which he has displayed good knowledge, well-founded advice and informed opinion.</p>
 
<p>His support and sympathetic, yet creative and positive outlook, have always enabled me to stay positive and grounded during injuries, helping me to balance my emotional response, during some trying times.</p>
 
<p>I am an older guy and has treated me, I am absolutely sure, in the same respectful way that he would a high-level athlete.</p>
 
<p>I have nothing but high regards for Mark's integrity, knowledge and utterly engaged support and would recommend him whole-heartedly.</p>

+ Specialised recovery exercises.<br>

Using Nutrition specialist, Physiotherapist, Podiatrist and sports masseur. <br>

<p><strong>Presenting Condition</strong><br>

Constant breakdown of calves /. Achilles.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanism of Injury</strong><br>
The missing toe has created body alignment issues. <br>
Heel spur to right foot (missing big toe on this foot).<br>
Shortening hamstrings and calves due, in part, sustained time in car and sitting at a desk.<br>
Breaking in of a running shoe and my gait adjustment. Often the later iteration of a trusted shoe has changed leading to  ore problems.<br>
Experimentation with new shoes has led to frustrating break downs and injury. <br>
I have to start training almost from zero to break the shoes in and acclimatise the leg muscles.<br>
When I find a good pair of shoes, I now buy an extra pair. I pair for the gym and one for the trail.<br>
I have learned the hard way to change shoes more frequently and accept that there will be a period of breaking in. Usually during a rest or close period of a 'season'.<br>
Mark has helped me to analyse and has make constructive observations to help me to navigate through this frustration and my at times lazy approach to try and get a quick fix.<br>
Injuries also arise from pushing my training too hard. Mark has helped me to take a more balanced, planned approach.<br>


<p><strong>Running challenge history.</strong><br>

Road runner - transition to trail. Result: increased longevity of running due to softer ground.</p>

<p>Inserts: after constant rotation of injury / physio I was directed to a specialist. Andrew Stanley Rebound Settle. I accepted his recommendation of tailored inserts. Within a year I did my first trail marathon.</p>

<p>I also was developing joint swelling issues. Eventually this was diagnosed as gout. I was proscribed allopurinol. I declined the drug and tried to resolve by 'diet'. I saw a decline in the urate levels naturally but then experienced 3 episodes close together. I decided to take the drug.  I later learned that the trauma caused by the changes in diet may have caused the swelling in the joints.</p>

<p>I began to have more of an understanding of the connectivity of nerves, muscles and bones throughout the body. I introduced yoga, strength building exercises and static weights programme with success.</p>

<p>I met a nutrition specialist who help me to assess my personal nutrition needs and has helped me to modify my diet further. In conjunction with the myfitnesspal.com app I learned that, while there should be moderate levels in all consumption, there were high intakes of carbs and too much simple and complex carbs and not enough protein.</p>

<p>I have reduced sugar, alcohol, increased water intake and reduced portions  - combined with exercise I have seen a gradual reduction in my weight.</p>

<p>Sleep - I have become a convert to the idea of sleep being the corner stone of everything in life. Concentration, mood, knowledge retention, brain waste clearance and injury recovery. Though not a good sleeper I enjoyed better sleep hygiene with an increase of 30 mins to 1 hour sleep per night.</p>

<p>I read that deep tissue massage might help with the connectivity issues and aid recovery. I was recommended specialist Mark Cowen.</p>

<p>I initially found this deep tissue massage painful. But after a few weeks I got used to the treatment and my body started to respond to the treatment. I found that it aided recovery and I felt good, if beaten up when the session was over. It was important to drink water and to allow the body to absorb the treatment the day after the session - light training.</p>

<p>Mark, as well as being an excellent sport masseur,  has also become an indispensable training mentor.</p>

<p>Over the years that I have worked with Mark he has been responsible for a change in my attitude towards injury recovery. Enabling me to develop a more mature, philosophical approach to time out from injury - resulting in a more balanced moods.</p>

<p>And he has enabled me to take a more philosophical approach to recovery so that my return to running has been enhanced. </p>

<p>Mark has the skill to listen and absorb what he is being told and has responded by giving some excellent knowledgeable feedback, and informed opinion that between us has challenged my thinking and the ideas that I have researched.</p>

<p>He has also helped me with my training plans and helped me to understand that it is good to have a plan but there needs to be flexibility in the plan and listening to the body is important.</p>

<p>He has helped me to find balance between training harder and resting hard. To try to move away from the macho approach to training that so often had led to break down.</p>
He has trained me to understand that being mentally tough is as much about doing the right thing in training than overtraining and finding the mental strength to survive the final leg of an ultra-marathon.</p>

<p>He also introduced me to the idea of managing my effort so that I save my big burns for the right occasions. Imagine a box of matches and you only have so many matches to burn - use them wisely and save them for the right occasions. Gradual training will build up a stock of matches.</p>

<p>Mark's consistent drip of this mental coaching and mentoring and patience (since I have to report injuries to him which are often an indicator that I have not followed planned protocols as well as I should.) </p>

<p>Just as importantly I am not a young athlete. Mark is an athlete and deals with some serious athletes on a daily basis. Yet I he gives me the care attention, thought and enthusiasm for my problems as he would for a top-class athlete in a non-patronising way.</p>

<p>Mark has also helped me to develop my own training plans. I was aware of the concept of resting is just as important as training in order or eth body to absorb the work and for the muscles to build. But I was not necessarily incorporating enough resting time into my training schedules for fear that I need to train hard and to try to catch up on lost time due to injury. Mark has coached me into accepting rest time and building it into my plan in quite a radical way.</p>

<p>I don't think it is a coincidence that I have seen my injuries make a small comeback since I have not been able to use Mark's services both as a masseur and as a mentor. Potential proof of Mark's skills and a deep tissue masseur but also because of his USP as a very good sports mentor.</p>

<p><strong>My goals.</strong><br>

Have matured over the years to suit myself knowledge, research and body.</p>

<p>Build robustness. (another Mark Cowen mantra - build robustness: have the patience to build robustness to make you near bullet proof on a properly executed training plan). </p>

<p>Sleep / recovery.</p>

<p>Diet attention - while not punishing self for occasional treats.</p>

<p>Sensible training planning with higher regard for built in rest (Mark Cowen has been responsible for getting me to accept that it is a tough thing to run an ultra - but is it tougher still to know when to ease off training and even do nothing - even when things seem to be going well).</p>

<p>Be flexible enough to change training plan. Do not be rigid in following a timetable. Be self-aware enough to know when to hold off or when to do a bit extra, to push a little harder.</p>

<p>Don't exercise binge - consistency.</p>

<p>Attitude adjustment towards injuries and accepting that they are inevitable. (Mark Cowen has been brilliant at this instilling this adoption).</p>

<p>Patience and building up fitness, strength, robustness.</p>

<p>Be opened ,minded and be prepared to listen.</p>

<p>Celebrate the small wins - (a Mark Cowen mantra)</p>

 
<p><strong>End result</strong><br>

I was spending about 40% of my time during a year injured I think that I have reduced that to around 20%. This seems a lot but studies have shown that mots runners will experience 1-2 injuries per years that will cost between a month to 2 or more. I attribute this improvement partly to my own research and development but also due to Mark's massage service and his mentoring input of which I would suggest he has been responsible for at least 50% of my recovery improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Cowen's impact during Covid-19 times</strong><br>

During this time of Covid it has been necessary to stop seeing Mark Cowen for his sports massage services for over a year.</p>

<p>During that year I have seen a change in muscle recovery as I have not benefited from a fortnightly muscle massage, resulting in increased post running soreness and overall muscle building and robustness in the legs.</p>

<p>I have learned resting, stretching, yoga and rolling techniques that have improved my recovery but this period of time has shown me that there is a clear benefit in Mark's massages.</p>

<p>But just as importantly I felt that I had lost some benefit in the regular face to face mentoring and discussion that is such a Unique Selling Point (USP) of meeting with mark on a regular basis to discuss running matters.</p>

After 3 months we introduced regular phone calls with Mark that has led to a significant improvement in my well-being, approach and boost to my training. It should be noted that I have had a number of back-to-back setbacks (eye operation, allergic reaction causing breathing issues (not Covid) and a calf injury all amounted to an unlucky four months of time out from training.</p>

<p>While I am a resilient character and self-driven it is undeniable that I have experienced some diminishing faith in what I can do.</p>

<p>Phone session with Mark have stabilised my mental approach and got me back into the regular patterns.</p>
