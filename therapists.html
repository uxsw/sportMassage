		<p><a href="therapists.html#mark" title="About Mark Cowen">Mark</a> has provided a deep tissue massage service for many years. In each session he has conscientiously and rigorously treated the muscle tissue to help to manage issues and to warn of potential pending issues. This has helped me to remain injury for as long as possible.</p>

 

<p>However, Mark has also provided a service as a mentor. Sounding out my training ideas and critiquing and challenging my thoughts and findings in such a way that has got me to think the extra step beyond each process; we have covered a multitude of aspects of running in which he has displayed good knowledge and well founded advice or good opinion on areas he declares he is not so sure about.</p>

 

<p>His support and sympathetic, yet, creative and positive outlook has always enable me to stay positive and grounded during injuries, helping me to balance my emotional response during some trying times.</p>

 

<p>I am older guy yet he has never sought to patronise me and has treated me, I am absolutely sure, in the same respectful way that he would a high level athlete.</p>

 

<p>I have nothing but high regards for Mark's integrity, knowledge and human support and would recommend him whole-heartedly.</p>
