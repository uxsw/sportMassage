	<p>Having raced for more years than I'd care to mention, I am aware that the best performances come from a mix of consistent, high quality training, self-awareness, and mental preparation.  Centre to all of this however is your bodies functionality - put simply, it's easier to perform well if your body is functioning properly. Unfortunately the stresses of training and racing can all too often build up and impair performance; sports massage is one of the key tools I use to combat this and ensure my body is working to the best of its ability. Utlising Marks hands for the first time during the 2012 race season the difference to race and training performance was notable and is something I am keen to continue with for the foreseeable future."</p>
