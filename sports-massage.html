		<p>Sports massage can be used in the treatment of specific injuries, such as hamstring strains, as well as to help correct muscle imbalances, overuse and postural issues. It was originally developed to help athletes prepare their bodies for optimal performance, recover after a big event, or function well during training. However, you don't have to be elite to benefit from sports massage. Sports massage is good for people with injuries, chronic pain or restricted range of motion. </p>
